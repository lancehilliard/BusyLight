# BusyLight üü• üëç

If you want to _automatically_ and _visually_ alert others nearby that you're busy, then BusyLight can help.

## Use Case

You're at your desk, using one or more devices (Windows desktop and/or laptop, mobile[1], etc) to perform work. You sometimes want to automatically signal "please don't interrupt me" to anyone nearby. BusyLight monitors your device activity and illuminates your [BlinkStick](https://www.blinkstick.com) during those moments.

BusyLight was built for a [BlinkStick Square](https://www.blinkstick.com/products/blinkstick-square). And, so far, it only tracks voice/video calls (the first two LEDs light up when software accesses[2] your microphone). What other BlinkStick products would you like it to support? What other work/activity would you like it to track?

## Prerequisite

BusyLight supports Windows 10 1903 or greater.

## Devices

BusyLight runs on the machine connected to your BlinkStick, and also on any other machine(s) you're working on. That _can_ mean a _single_ device, if you just want to monitor one PC, but BusyLight's strength lay in monitoring _multiple_ devices for activity.

## Requirements

* A [BlinkStick Square](https://www.blinkstick.com/products/blinkstick-square) must be connected to at least one Windows machine running BusyLight.
  * otherwise, BusyLight will display a simulation of BlinkStick activity
    * (good for testing, if you're still debating the device purchase)
* Some [configuration](https://github.com/lancehilliard/BusyLight/wiki/Configuration), including an [AMQP URL](https://github.com/lancehilliard/BusyLight/wiki/Messaging), must  be specified on every machine running BusyLight.

## Running the Software

See [Running the Software](https://github.com/lancehilliard/BusyLight/wiki/Running-the-Software) to get started.

### Notes
* [1] Are you working from your mobile phone, too? Check our [Mobile wiki page](https://github.com/lancehilliard/BusyLight/wiki/Mobile) for ideas!
* [2] Microphone mute/unmute is not tracked. Illumination occurs for the entire call, muted or not.
